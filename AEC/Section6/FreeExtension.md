# Free lift

From [Theorem 6.10](Theorem_6.10.md).

Theorem 6.10 (Stationary free extension). Let $A \to B$ be an arrow at a sufficiently closed level and let $p = \mathrm{tp}(v/A)$, where $|v| \le \sigma$. There is a specified actual type $p_B$ over $B$, called its free lift, extending $p$. At every desired query size whose approximation and testing costs are bounded at the originating level, it is computed by transporting sufficiently long approximations in $A$. At one level this includes every bounded query size; in a mixed-level use the costs must remain below the level of $A$.

We say that an actual type over $B$ is free from $A$ when it is the free lift of its restriction to $A$.
